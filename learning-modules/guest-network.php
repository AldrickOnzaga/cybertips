          <p>Why would you create a guest network? If it is to give a guest access to the internet, then why don't you use your private network for your guest? because of security threats. On the second page of the module, "Best practices that may help you," it will show you how to create a guest network.</p>
          <p>On the previous page, the module talked about how you should use a strong password to keep your devices hard to crack, easy to access, and exclusive to the person who uses them. It is also taught how to go to the admin page or network configuration page of the router. Now access the admin page or network configuration page to create a guest network.</p>
          <p>The guest network is a separate network from your private network, or primary network, which you use on your devices. The guest network is usually used by guests to connect to the internet.</p>
          <p>Routers have an easy-to-setup guest network; however, some routers don't have this feature; therefore, this module will show you how to create a guest network. After you log in to the admin page or network configuration page, find guest network or guest access.</p>
          <div class="module-img">
            <img src="../resources/guest.png" alt="guest-network" />
          </div>
          <p>Now you have created a guest network for your guest.</p>
          <h2>
            Conclusion
          </h2>
          <p>Creating a guest network for your guests is hospitable and also one of the best practices to avoid getting malicious programs or files into your network. It is essentially necessary to put a password on your guest network; it is preferable to use WPA2 or WPA3 for your security.</p>
          <p>You can take a short quiz if you understand how important this module is. <a href=""#>Quiz here</a></p>
